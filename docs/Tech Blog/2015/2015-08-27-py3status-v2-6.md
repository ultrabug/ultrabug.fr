Ok I was a bit too hasty in my legacy module support code clean up and I broke quite a few things on the latest version 2.5 release sorry ! :(

## highlights

- make use of pkgutil to **detect properly installed modules** even when they are zipped in egg files (manual install)
- add back legacy modules output support (tuple of position / response)
- new **uname** module inspired from [issue 117](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/issues/117) thanks to @ndalliard
- remove dead code

## thanks !

- @**coelebs** on IRC for reporting, testing and the good spirit :)
- @**ndalliard** on github for the issue, debug and for inspiring the uname module
- @**Horgix** for responding to issues faster than me !
