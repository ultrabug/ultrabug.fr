I'm more than two weeks late but I'm very glad to announce the release of **[py3status](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status) v2.7** which features a lot of [interesting stuff](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/master/CHANGELOG) !

For this release I want to salute the significant work and help of **Daniel Foerster** (@pydsigner), who discovered and fixed a bug in the event detection loop.

The result is a **greatly improved click event detection and bar update speed** with a largely **reduced CPU consumption** and less code !
