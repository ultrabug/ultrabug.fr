I'm very pleased to announce the release of **py3status v2.0** which I'd like to dedicate to the person who's behind all the nice improvements this release features : **@tablet-mode** !

His idea on [issue #44](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/issues/44) was to make py3status modules configurable. After some thoughts and merges of my own plans of development, we ended up with what I believe are **the most ambitious features** py3status provides so far.

## Features

The logic behind this release is that **py3status now wraps and extends your i3status.conf** which allows all the following crazy features :

- **[Handle all click events directly from your i3status config](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/wiki/Handle-click-events-directly-from-your-i3status-config)**

**For all your i3bar modules i3status and py3status alike** thanks to the new _on\_click parameter_ which you can use like any other i3status.conf parameter on all modules. It has never been so easy to handle click events !

This is a quick and small [example](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/wiki/Handle-click-events-directly-from-your-i3status-config#examples) of what it looks like :

```
# run thunar when I left click on the / disk info module
disk / {
    format = "/ %free"
    on_click 1 = "exec thunar /"
}
```

- All py3status contributed modules are now shipped and usable directly **without the need to copy them to your local folder**. They also get to be configurable directly from your i3status config (see below)

No need to copy and edit the contributed py3status modules you like and wish to use, you can now **load and configure them directly from your i3status.conf**.

- **[Load, configure and order py3status modules directly from your i3status config](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/wiki/Load-and-order-py3status-modules-directly-from-your-current-i3status-config)** just like any other i3status module

All py3status modules (contributed ones and user loaded ones) are now **loaded and ordered** using the usual syntax **order +=** in your i3status.conf !

- [All modules](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/tree/master/py3status/modules) have been improved, cleaned up and some of them got some love from contributors.
- Every click event now triggers a refresh of the clicked module, even for i3status modules. This makes your i3bar more responsive than ever !
