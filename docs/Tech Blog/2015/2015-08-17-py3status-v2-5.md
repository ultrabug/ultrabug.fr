This new **py3status** comes with an amazing number of contributions and new modules !

24 files changed, 1900 insertions(+), 263 deletions(-)

I'm also glad to say that py3status becomes my first commit in the [new git repository of Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/news/2015/08/12/git-migration.html) !

## IMPORTANT

Please note that this version has **deprecated the legacy implicit module loading support** to favour and focus on the generic [i3status _order +=_ module loading/ordering](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/wiki/Load-and-order-py3status-modules-directly-from-your-current-i3status-config) !
