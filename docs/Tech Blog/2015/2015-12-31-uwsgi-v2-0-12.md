It's been a long time since I made a blog post about a **uWSGI** release but this one is special to me because it contains some features I asked for to a colleague of mine.

For his first contributions to a big Open Source project, our fellow @**shir0kamii** added two features (spooler\_get\_task and -if-hostname-match) which were backported in this release and that we needed at work for quite a long time : congratulations again :)

## Highlights

- official **PHP 7 support**
- uwsgi.**spooler\_get\_task** API to easily read and inspect a spooler file from your code
- \-if-hostname-match regexp on uWSGI configuration files to allow a more flexible configuration based on the hostname of the machine

Of course, all of this is already available on **Gentoo** Linux !

Full [changelog here](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Changelog-2.0.12.html) as usual.
