_Ok I slacked by not posting for v3.1 and v3.2 and I should have since those previous versions were awesome and feature rich._

But **v3.3** is another [major milestone](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/milestone/2?closed=1) which was made possible by tremendous contributions from @**tobes** as usual and also greatly thanks to the hard work of @**guiniol** and @**pferate** who I'd like to mention and thank again !

**Also, I'd like to mention that @tobes has become the first collaborator of the py3status project !**

Instead of doing a changelog review, I'll highlight some of the key features that got introduced and extended during those versions.

## The py3 helper

Writing powerful py3status modules have never been so easy thanks to the [py3 helper](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/tree/master/doc#py3) !

This magical object is added automatically to modules and provides a lot of useful methods to help normalize and enhance modules capabilities. This is a non exhaustive list of such methods:

- **format\_units**: to pretty format units (KB, MB etc)
- **notify\_user:** send a notification to the user
- **time\_in**: to handle module cache expiration easily
- **safe\_format**: use the extended formatter to handle the module's output in a powerful way (see below)
- **check\_commands:** check if the listed commands are available on the system
- **command\_run:** execute the given command
- **command\_output:** execute the command and get its output
- **play\_sound**: sound notifications !

## Powerful control over the modules' output

Using the **self.py3.safe\_format** helper will unleash a feature rich formatter that one can use to conditionally select the output of a module based on its content.

- Square brackets `[]` can be used. The content of them will be removed from the output if there is no valid placeholder contained within. They can also be nested.
- A pipe (vertical bar) `|` can be used to divide sections the first valid section only will be shown in the output.
- A backslash `\` can be used to escape a character eg `\[` will show `[` in the output.
- `\?` is special and is used to provide extra commands to the format string, example `\?color=#FF00FF`. Multiple commands can be given using an ampersand `&` as a separator, example `\?color=#FF00FF&show`.
- `{<placeholder>}` will be converted, or removed if it is None or empty. Formatting can also be applied to the placeholder eg `{number:03.2f}`.

### Example format\_string:

This will show `artist - title` if artist is present, `title` if title but no artist, and `file` if file is present but not artist or title.

"\[\[{artist} - \]{title}\]|{file}"

## More code and documentation tests

A lot of efforts have been put into py3status automated CI and feature testing allowing more confidence in the advanced features we develop while keeping a higher standard on code quality.

This is such as even modules' docstrings are now tested for bad formatting :)

Colouring and thresholds

A special effort have been put in normalizing modules' output colouring with the added refinement of normalized thresholds to give users more power over their output.

- See the [colouring documentation](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/tree/master/doc#configuring_color)
- See the [thresholds documentation](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/tree/master/doc#configuring_thresholds)

## Changelog

[The changelog](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/3.3/CHANGELOG) is very big and the next 3.4 milestone is very promising with amazing new features giving you even more power over your i3bar, stay tuned !

## Thank you contributors

Still a lot of new timer contributors which I take great pride in as I see it as py3status being an accessible project.
