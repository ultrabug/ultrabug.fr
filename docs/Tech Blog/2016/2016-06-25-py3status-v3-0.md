Oh boy, this new version is so amazing in terms of improvements and contributions that it's hard to sum it up !

Before going into more explanations I want to dedicate this release to **tobes** whose contributions, hard work and patience have permitted this ambitious 3.0 : **THANK YOU** !

This is the graph of contributed commits since 2.9 just so you realise how much this version is thanks to him: [![2016-06-25-165245_1289x248_scrot](images/2016-06-25-165245_1289x248_scrot.png)](http://www.ultrabug.fr/py3status-v3-0/2016-06-25-165245_1289x248_scrot/)I can't continue on without also thanking **Horgix** who started this madness by splitting the code base into modular files and **pydsigner** for his everlasting contributions and code reviews !

The git stat since 2.9 also speaks for itself:

 73 files changed, 7600 insertions(+), 3406 deletions(-)

## So what's new ?

- the monolithic **code base have been split into modules** responsible for the given tasks py3status performs
- major improvements on modules output orchestration and execution resulting in **considerable CPU consumption reduction and i3bar responsiveness**
- refactoring of **user notifications with added dbus support** and rate limiting
- improved **modules error reporting**
- py3status can now **survive an i3status crash** and will try to respawn it
- a new 'container' module output type gives the **ability to group modules together**
- **refactoring of the time and tztime modules support** brings the support of all the time macros (%d, %Z etc)
- **support** for stopping py3status and its modules when **i3bar hide mode** is used
- refactoring of general, contribution and most noticeably modules **documentation**
- [more details on the rest of the changelog](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/master/CHANGELOG)
