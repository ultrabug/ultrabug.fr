Yesterday was a big day for the famous application container **uWSGI**. We released the brand new version 2.0 LTS along with quite a huge bump of the ebuild, closing 6 bugs at once. I thought I'd give some input about the ebuild changes and some quick notes about uWSGI. Many thanks again to **@dev-zero** !

## New plugins selection : UWSGI_PLUGINS

We introduced a new **USE_EXPAND** named **UWSGI_PLUGINS** so that you can now select which plugins to build individually. This is a great step as it makes the compilation more clear and lets you fine tune your uWSGI installation.

Along this work, we had to describe each plugin which was also quite a challenge. To my knownledge, this has not been done anywhere else so [here it is](http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/profiles/desc/uwsgi_plugins.desc?view=markup). Please ping me if you have something to add or if we failed to describe a plugin correctly.

**Migration note :** You will need to change your package.use configuration to switch to using UWSGI_PLUGINS. As an example, where you had the USE flag _spooler_ enabled you'll now need to use _uwsgi_plugins_spooler_.
