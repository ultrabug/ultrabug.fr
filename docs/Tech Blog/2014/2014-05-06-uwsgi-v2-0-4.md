Quick post for an interesting version bump of uWSGI which brings an experimental loopengine for [**python3.4 asyncio**](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/asyncio.html) (aka tulip) !

If you want to try it out, I added a **python\_asyncio** USE flag. I've also made some cleanups on the ebuild wrt python versions and dropped older versions of uWSGI.

## highlights

- experimental asyncio loop engine (python 3.4 only)
- httprouter advanced timeout management
- **purge LRU cache (v2) feature**
- allow duplicate headers in http parsers
- faster on\_demand Emperor management
- fixed segfault for unnamed loggers

See the full [changelog](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Changelog-2.0.4.html) here.
