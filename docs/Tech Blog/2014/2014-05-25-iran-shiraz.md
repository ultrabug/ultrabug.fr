Our Iranian friend booked us a night train from Tehran to our next stop in the South of Iran : **Shiraz**.

The Tehran train station is well organized and as foreigners we had to show our passports to the station's police where we were greeted with the big smile by the policemen. The train itself was good, clean, comfortable and on schedule even if it was quite slow : departure at 20h and we arrived at 11h30 a few kilometers up from Shiraz.

Travelling by train is always a great experience. As we woke up early in the morning, this is what was waiting for us behind the curtains :

Compared to Tehran, the streets are more typical and fitting what you'd expect from a _desert_ city. That's the exact kind of town you want to get lost in, just walking around and going into its nice and large bazaar.

Shiraz is known for its many palaces and beautiful gardens.

This city is also the usual starting point to visit the famous **Persepolis**. While the place is great, I must admit that we loved the _abandonned_Â park right next to it which is used as a playground and food camping by the schools and other Iranian tourists.
