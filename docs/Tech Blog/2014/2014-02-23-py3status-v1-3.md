I'm glad to announce the release of **py3status v1.3** which brings to life a feature request from @**tasse** and @**ttyE0**. Guys, I hope this one will please you !

## what's new ?

Along with a [localization bug](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/issues/24) fix thanks to @**zetok** from Poland, the main new feature is that py3status now supports a **standalone mode** which you can use **when you only want your own modules displayed in an i3bar** !

As usual, this release is already available for my fellow Gentoo Linux users and on pypi !

[Changelog is here](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/master/CHANGELOG) and quick to get, enjoy !
