I'm pleased to announce those latest mongoDB related bumps. The next version bump will be for [the brand new mongoDB 2.6](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/82092813806/mongodb-2-6-our-biggest-release-ever) for which I'll add some improvements to the Gentoo ebuild so stay tuned ;)

## mongodb-2.4.10

- fixes some memory leaks
- start elections if more than one primary is detected
- fixes issues about indexes building and replication on secondaries
- chunk size is decreased to 255 KB (from 256 KB) to avoid overhead with usePowerOf2Sizes option

All [mongodb-2.4.10 changelog](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/2.4-changelog/) here.

## pymongo-2.7

- of course, the main feature is the mongoDB 2.6 support
- [new bulk write API](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/examples/bulk.html) (I love it)
- much improved concurrency control for MongoClient
- support for GridFS queries
