I'm glad to announce a new release of **py3status** with an exciting main new feature **giving the ability to modify any of i3status' module output** from any of your modules !

## feature

- you can now [change i3status modules' output](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/wiki/Write-your-own-modules) by altering the **i3status_output_json** parameter received in any of your module !

## changelog

- new module dpms.py allowing activation and deactivation of DPMS thx to **André Doser**
- order i3status output updates to prevent it from overwritting any modification made on i3status json list by a user module, this avoids a possible user filter flapping on i3status modules
- fix delay on first execution of each module which could be equal to py3status interval time before being executed : **your modules get executed and displayed immediately no matter py3status' interval**
- the real i3status thread output json list is passed to all modules as the i3status_output_json parameter, **this allows any user module to change any of the i3status output by simply altering the given json on the list**, inspired thx to **@drestebon** on issue #23
- add validation for the position parameter
- add cpu usage info to sysdata script, by **Patrick Shan**
