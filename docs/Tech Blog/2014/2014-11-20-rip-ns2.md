Today we did shutdown our now oldest running Gentoo Linux production server : **ns2**.

Obviously this machine was happily spreading our DNS records around the world but what's remarkable about it is that it has been doing so forÂ **2717 straight days** !

$ uptime
 13:00:45 up 2717 days,  2:20,  1 user,  load average: 0.13, 0.04, 0.01

As I mentioned when we did shutdown [stabber](http://www.ultrabug.fr/rip-stabber/), our beloved firewall, our company has been running Gentoo Linux servers in production for a long time now and we're always a bit sad when we have to power off one of them.

As usual, I want to take this chance to **thank everyone contributing to Gentoo Linux** ! Without our collective work, none of this would have been possible.
