I'm glad to announce a new (awaited) release of **py3status** featuring support for the **sway window manager** which allows py3status to enter the wayland environment!

### Updated configuration and custom modules paths detection

The [configuration section](https://py3status.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html) of the documentation explains the updated detection of the py3status configuration file (with respect of XDG\_CONFIG environment variables):

- ~/.config/py3status/config
- ~/.config/i3status/config
- ~/.config/i3/i3status.conf
- ~/.i3status.conf
- ~/.i3/i3status.conf
- /etc/xdg/i3status/config
- /etc/i3status.conf

Regarding [custom modules paths detection](https://py3status.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_modules.html), py3status does as described in the documentation:

- ~/.config/py3status/modules
- ~/.config/i3status/py3status
- ~/.config/i3/py3status
- ~/.i3/py3status

### Highlights

Lots of modules improvements and clean ups, see [changelog](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/master/CHANGELOG).

- we worked on the **documentation** sections and content which allowed us to fix a bunch of typos
- our magic **@lasers** have worked a lot on harmonizing thresholds on modules along with a lot of code clean ups
- new module: [scroll](https://py3status.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules.html#scroll) to scroll modules on your bar (#1748)
- **@lasers** has worked a lot on a more granular pango support for modules output (still work to do as it breaks some composites)
