This important release has been long awaited as it focused on improving overall **performance** of **py3status** as well as dramatically decreasing its **memory footprint**!

I want once again to salute the impressive work of @**lasers,** our amazing contributors from the USA who has become **top one contributor of 2017** in term of commits and PRs.

Thanks to him, this release brings a whole batch of improvements and QA clean ups on various modules. I encourage you to go through the [changelog](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/master/CHANGELOG) to see everything.

## Highlights

Deep rework of the usage and scheduling of threads to run modules has been done by @tobes.

- Â now **py3status does not keep one thread per module running permanently** but instead uses a queue to spawn a thread to execute the module only when its cache expires
- this new scheduling and usage of threads allows py3status to run under asynchronous event loops and gevent will be supported on the upcoming 3.8
- memory footprint of py3status got largely reduced thanks to the threads modifications and thanks to a nice hunt on ever growing and useless variables
- modules error reporting is now more detailed

## Milestone 3.8

The next release will bring some awesome new features such as **gevent support**, **environment variable** support in config file and per **module persistent data storage** as well as new modules!

## Thanks contributors!

This release is their work, thanks a lot guys!
