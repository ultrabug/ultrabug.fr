Another community driven and incredible update of **py3status** has been released !

**Our contributor star for this release** is without doubt **@lasers** who is showing some amazing energy with [challenging ideas](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/issues/667) and some impressive modules QA clean ups !

Thanks a lot as usual to **@tobes** who is basically leading the development of py3status now days with me being in a merge button mode most of the time.

By looking at the issues and pull requests I can already say that the 3.5 release will be grand !

## Highlights

- **support of python 3.6** thanks to @tobes
- a major effort in modules standardization, almost all of them support the format parameter now thanks to @lasers
- modules documentation has been cleaned up
- **new do_not_disturb module** to toggle notifications, by @maximbaz
- **new rss_aggregator module** to display your unread feed items, by @raspbeguy
- **whatsmyip module: added geolocation support** using ip-api.com, by @vicyap with original code from @neutronst4r

See the full [changelog](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/master/CHANGELOG) here.

Thank you guys !
