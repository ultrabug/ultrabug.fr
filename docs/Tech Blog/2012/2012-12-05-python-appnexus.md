On [my earlier blog post about python](http://www.ultrabug.fr/my-views-on-python/) I talked about [Appnexus'](http://techblog.appnexus.com/2012/pydata-2012-rapid-iteration-with-python-scaling-appnexus/) motivation and use cases of this language. The PyData 2012 video of the talk is available now and I strongly encourage you to listen to it as it's not only focused on python but covers also teamwork management and organization.
