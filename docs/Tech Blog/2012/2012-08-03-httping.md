Quick post about a great tool I came across to test the response time of  a web service : [httping](http://www.vanheusden.com/httping/)

As its name suggests, it's like ping but for http requests ! Its [options](http://linux.die.net/man/1/httping) are vast enough to fit with any of your dreams so just try it out, it's a must-have.

Sample usage :

$ httping -g 'http://google.com'

PING google.com:80 (http://google.com):
connected to 74.125.230.195:80 (321 bytes), seq=0 time=17.70 ms 
connected to 74.125.230.197:80 (321 bytes), seq=1 time=13.97 ms 
connected to 74.125.230.199:80 (321 bytes), seq=2 time=20.49 ms

PS: yes, you can emerge it.
