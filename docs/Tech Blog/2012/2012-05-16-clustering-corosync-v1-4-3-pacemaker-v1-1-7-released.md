I've finally taken the time to take care of the **corosync** and **pacemaker** ebuilds. The new versions are now available in portage.

# Corosync 1.4.3 (10/04/2012)

This is one of the last supported old stable release of the Corosync Cluster Engine. FYI, I've also bumped the new corosync-2.0.0 version but it needs more testing before I hard-unmask it.

# Pacemaker 1.1.7 (28/03/12)

This is a bug fix release of Pacemaker. See the [changelog](https://github.com/ClusterLabs/pacemaker/commit/ee0730e13d124c3d58f00016c3376a1de5323cff) for details.

Special thanks to my fellow Gentoo Linux developer Kacper Kowalik (xarthisius) for his help on these bumps.
