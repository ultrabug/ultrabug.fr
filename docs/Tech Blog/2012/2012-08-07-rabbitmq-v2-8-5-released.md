[As the new maintainer](http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/gentoo/dev/257215) of **net-misc/rabbitmq-server** , I'm pleased to announce the availability of the bug fix release 2.8.5 of our beloved Rabbit Message Queuing server.

A special care have been taken on HA queues, so read the [Changelog](http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-announce/attachments/20120802/e4ad3dd3/attachment.txt) for more details.
