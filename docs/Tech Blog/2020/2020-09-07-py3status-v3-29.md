Almost 5 months after the latest release (thank you COVID) I'm pleased and relieved to have finally packaged and pushed **py3status v3.29** to PyPi and Gentoo portage!

This release comes with a lot of interesting contributions from quite a bunch of first-time contributors so I thought that I'd thank them first for a change!

## Thank you contributors!

- Marc Poulhiès
- Markus Sommer

- Yaroslav Dronskii

## So what's new in v3.29?

Two new exciting modules are in!

- **prometheus** module: to display your promQL queries on your bar
- **watson** module: for the watson time-tracking tool

Then some interesting bug fixes and enhancements are to be noted

- py3.requests: return empty json on remote server problem fix #1401
- core modules: remove deprectated function, fix type annotation support (#1942)

Some modules also got improved

- **battery_level** module: add power consumption placeholder (#1939) + support more battery paths detection (#1946)
- **do_not_disturb** module: change pause default from False to True
- **mpris** module: implement broken chromium mpris interface workaround (#1943)
- **sysdata** module: add {mem,swap}_free, {mem,swap}_free_unit, {mem,swap}_free_percent + try to use default intel/amd sensors first
- **google_calendar** module: fix imports for newer google-python-client-api versions (#1948)

Next version of py3status will certainly drop support for EOL Python 3.5!
