Today's bumps are interesting, kudos to both upstreams for their work.

## mongodb-2.2.3

The main benefit of this version is the performance improvements on replicaSets. You can see the [changelog here](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER/fixforversion/12088).

## uwsgi-1.4.5

This one is quite a bump. I was particulary interested to know that the memory leak discovered on the gevent loop got fixed. Have a look at all the nice backports too, they're worth it.

- added --python-version and --perl-version
- **fixed a gevent memory leak**
- backported --extract option
- added HTTP_Authorization support in mod_proxy_uwsgi
- **backported** --php-fallback
- **backported** perl uwsgi::postfork and uwsgi::atexit
- fixed a memory leak with --http-socket during uploads
- fixed unix signals usage in mules and spoolers
- reset cores/requests on worker startup
- fixed a refcnt bug in python uwsgi.workers()
- **fixed async mode when multiple fds are in place**
- fixed a cache collision bug
- **backported** --emperor-procname
- **backported** --touch-reload refactoring from 1.5
- **backported** master+emperor fix from 1.5
- new rbtree implementation (based on nginx) backported from 1.5
- backported new logvars from 1.5
