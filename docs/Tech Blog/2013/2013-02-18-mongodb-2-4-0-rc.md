Last month [I talked about what was coming](http://www.ultrabug.fr/coming-soon-on-mongodb/) on the next major stable release of mongoDB and I'm glad to point you to the recent [2.4.0 release notes](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/release-notes/2.4-changes/) which were announced today.

Undoubtedly, the "new" cool stuff is about the **hashed index feature**Â which will help those who don't have a really even shard key to distribute their data on. Promising future as always !
