I've been slacking on this package for some months but slowly got the chance to catch-up with the multiple bugs open. So today I'm glad to say to make this blog post not only for a version bump release but also for some nice added features and ebuild improvements fixing 6 bugs in a row.

## ebuild

- added support for the [mongoDB output template module](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=494268) thanks to Vadim Kuznetsov
- added support for [sub-slot operators](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sub-slots_and_Slot-Operators) for json-c and libgcrypt dependencies using EAPI5 thanks to Thomas D.
- libgcrypt is now a required dependency of rsyslog as I didn't want to add another USE flag for such a widely spread dependency
- I've also bumped net-libs/czmq with approval of @jlec which fixes dependencies when trying to build rsyslog with zeromq support, thanks to Allen Parker for his [report](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=495198) and valuable debugging

## rsyslog v7.4.7

This is a bugfix release, see the [full changelog here](http://www.rsyslog.com/changelog-for-7-4-7-v7-stable/).
