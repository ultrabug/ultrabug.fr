Earlier this week, Wietse Venema announced the latest stable release of **postfix**, the famous Mail Transfer Agent. As I'm a long time user of this MTA, I thought I'd give it an echo on my blog with the usual highlights for you lazy readers.

## highlights

- Separation of relay policy (with smtpd_relay_restrictions) from spam policy (with smtpd_{client, helo, sender, recipient}_restrictions), which makes accidental open relay configuration less likely. The default is backwards compatible.
- **HAproxy** load-balancer support for postscreen(8) and smtpd(8). The **nginx** proxy was already supported by Postfix 2.9 smtpd(8), using XCLIENT commands.
- Support for the TLSv1 and TLSv2 protocols, as well as support to turn them off if needed for inter-operability.
- **Laptop-friendly** configuration. By default, Postfix now uses UNIX-domain sockets instead of FIFOs, and thus avoids MTIME file system updates on an idle mail system.
- Revised **postconf**(1) command. The "-x" option expands $name in a parameter value (both main.cf and master.cf); the "-o name=value" option overrides a main.cf parameter setting; and postconf(1) now warns about a $name that has no name=value setting.
