First of all **py3status** [is on pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py3status/0.9) ! You can now install it with the simple and usual :

$ pip install py3status

This new version features my first pull request from @**Fandekasp** who kindly wrote a pomodoro module which helps this [technique's](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com) adepts by having a counter on their bar. I also fixed a few glitches on module injection and some documentation.
