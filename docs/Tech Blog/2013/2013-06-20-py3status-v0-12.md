I'm glad to announce a new release of **py3status** ! I would like to thank **@drahier** for reporting an issue he found after suspending his computer. I took the opportunity to add a feature which will be helpful at work since we now have a local package installing some modules we share between colleagues (thx to @lujeni).

## changelog

- bugfix : don't hang horribly when resuming from a suspend (was caused by an IOError exception which could occur when reading/writing to a suspending system).
- feature : **allow multiple _\-i include_path_ options to be passed** and handle all the modules thus found.
- feature : **do not try to execute private and special methods** on user-written Py3status' classes.
