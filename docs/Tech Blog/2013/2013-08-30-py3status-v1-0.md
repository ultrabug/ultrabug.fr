I'm glad to announce the release of [**py3status**](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status) v1.0 !

This version features a lot of stuff that I wanted to add to py3status for a long time and which I had in a small todo floating around. After the recent [i3wm 4.6](http://i3wm.org/downloads/RELEASE-NOTES-4.6.txt)Â release, I found it the perfect time to implement them while benefiting from the new **click event support from i3bar**.

The idea of allowing py3status users to have their modules respond to clicks got my head fuzzing and I started slowly to implement my whole todo while adding some great new features thanks to the enhanced [i3bar protocol](http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/commit/?h=next&id=58e68940f646e7f3a61d0e5128dfb5f4adef3df2).

I ended up rewriting (again) completely (and slowly) py3status :) But it's for its own good, and yours hopefully. I strongly encourage you to **have a look at the empty_class.py and pomodoro.py** examples as they showcase the new on_click system.

You can already benefit from this bump without modifying your modules thanks to the default middle click event which forces a refresh of the module's method you click on (handy isn't it?).

## changelog

- **support for i3bar click_events**, they're dispatched to user-written py3status classes based on their name/instance
- **add support for on_click methods in user-written modules** to handle i3bar click_events (see the pomodoro example)
- default is to clear the method's cache (force a refresh) if you middle click (button 2) on a method's output and the module does not support click_events
- rewrite pomodoro example to showcase the on_click usage
- **use i3-nagbar to display warnings/errors** to the user and also log them to syslog
- **new user-written module output ordering** mechanism is more intuitive as it uses strictly numeric then alphabetical sorting
- use select/poll() to implement a non-blocking I/O reading mechanism on threads
- new Events thread is responsible for reading i3bar JSONs and dispatching them to the correct user module (click_events)
- **each user-written module is started and executed in its own thread**
- **remove the pointless -d option**
- **add a --debug option** to be verbose in syslog (useful for debugging your modules)
- add a real CHANGELOG
- add a proper LICENSE file
- make sure all examples are PEP8 compatible
- **update the empty_class example to explain on_click and kill usage**

**Note for Gentoo users** : starting with this release, **py3status is now available in portage** so you don't need my overlay anymore.
