More than 5 months since the last bump of pacemaker. I'm glad that @beekhof did release the final pacemaker-1.1.10 and that the officially stable corosync got bumped to 2.3.1.

The changelogs are quite heavy so I won't go into details about them but they both have quite a nice bunch of bugfixes and compatibility features. That's why I'm hoping we should soon be able to [fix bug #429416](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=429416#c14) and drop corosync hard mask. Hopefully some users such asÂ **@pvsa** will give us some valuable feedback which will allow us to do it smoothly.
