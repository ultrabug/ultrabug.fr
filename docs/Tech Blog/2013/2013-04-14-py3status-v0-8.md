I went on a coding frenzy to implement most of the stuff I was not happy with py3status so far. Here comes [py3status code name : San Francisco](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/tree/0.8) (more photos to come).

## PEP8

I always had the habit of using tabulators to indent my code. @[Lujeni](http://www.thebault.co/) pointed out that [this is not a PEP8 recommended](http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html#pep-8-style-guide-for-python-code) method and that we should start respecting more of it in the near future. Well, he's right and I guess it was time to move on so I switched to **using spaces** and **corrected** a lot of other coding style stuff which got my code a score going from around -1/10 to around 9.5/10 on **pylint** !

## Threaded modules' execution

This was the major thing I was not happy with : when a user-written module was executed for injection, the time it took to get its response would cause py3status to stop updating the bar. This means that if you had a database call to make to get some stuff you need displayed on the bar and it took 10 seconds, py3status was sleeping for those 10 seconds to update the bar ! This behavior could cause some delays in the clock ticking for example.

I decided to offload all of the modules' detection and execution to a **thread** to solve this problem. To be frank, this also helped to rationalize the code better as well. No more delays and a cleaner handling is what you get, stuff will start appending themselves whatever the time they take to execute !

## Python3

It was about time the **examples** available on py3status would also work using python3.
