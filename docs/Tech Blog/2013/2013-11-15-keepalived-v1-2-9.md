Another release, 3 months after the mighty 1.2.8. It seems like upstream has awaken !

## highlights

- Jonas Johansson fixed VRRP sync group by sending prio 0 when entering FAULT state. This fix will send prio 0 (VRRP_PRIO_STOP) when the VRRP router transists from MASTER to FAULT state. **This will make a sync group leave the MASTER state more quickly** by notifying the backup router(s) instead of having them to wait for time out.
- Jonas Johansson fixed VRRP to honor preempt_delay setting on startup.
- Jonas Johansson extended VRRP code for faster sync group transition.
- Some nice bug fixes to unicast mode.
