Hey **Gentoo** folks !

I finally followed a friend's advice and stepped into the [Gentoo Planet and Universe](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/userrel/planet/) feeds. I hope my modest contributions will help and be of interest to some of you readers.

As you'll see, I don't talk only about Gentoo but also about photography and technology more generally. I also often post about the packages I maintain or I have an interest in to highlight their key features or bug fixes.
