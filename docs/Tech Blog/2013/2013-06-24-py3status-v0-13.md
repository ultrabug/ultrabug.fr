Yep, a quick bump of py3status to fix a [bug reported by @lathan](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/issues/11) using python3. The private and special methods detection didn't work on python3 because the class methods are reported differently from python2.

A special thanks to @bloodred and @drahier too for debugging, testing and [proposing some solutions](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/pull/12) to this problem. First time I see multiple members of what I could humbly call the _py3status community_ working together, it's very nice of you guys !
