I'm glad to announce the v1.1 release of **py3status**, roughly 6 months after v1.0 which features some nice and often contributed bug fixes and some exciting new features !

## fixes / enhancements

- allow float on refresh interval option
- fix respect user's locale for time transformation
- fix i3status time adjustment when format does not contain the necessary items to get an exact datetime
- fix delay on py3status start waiting for i3status, this caused a useless first refresh delay of py3status of i3status interval seconds
- fix first click event opening line detection
- redirect stdout and stderr to null to suppress modules outputs, this prevents i3bar from frezzing when a user module prints something to stdout or stderr, [more info](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/wiki/Write-your-own-modules#remember)

## features

**Thanks to py3status, you can now take action on clicks made on your i3status modules !**

- the new **i3bar_click_events.py** module allows you to implement some actions when clicking on your i3bar modules
- [more info in the wiki](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/wiki/handle-i3status-and-i3bar-click-events) and in the [source code of the module](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/master/examples/i3bar_click_events.py)

## new modules

- new generic click event handler using the special module file named **i3bar_click_events.py** which will be forwarded any orphan click event for action
- new example module displaying Yahoo Weather forcast
- new example whoami displaying the currently logged in user, inspired by user request on i3 FAQ
