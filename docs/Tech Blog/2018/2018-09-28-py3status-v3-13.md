I am once again lagging behind the release blog posts but this one is an important one.

I'm proud to announce that our long time contributor **@lasers** has become an official collaborator of the py3status project!

Dear **@[lasers](https://github.com/lasers)**, your amazing energy and overwhelming ideas have served our little community for a while. I'm sure we'll have a great way forward as we learn to work together with @tobes :) Thank you again very much for everything you do!

This release is as much dedicated to you as it is yours :)

## IMPORTANT notice

After this release, py3status coding style CI will enforce the '[black](https://pypi.org/project/black/)' formatter style.  

## Highlights

Needless to say that the [changelog](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/master/CHANGELOG) is huge, as usual, here is a very condensed view:

- documentation updates, especially on the formatter (thanks @L0ric0)  
    
- py3 storage: use $XDG_CACHE_HOME or ~/.cache
- formatter: multiple variable and feature fixes and enhancements
- better config parser
- new modules: lm_sensors, loadavg, mail, nvidia_smi, sql, timewarrior, wanda_the_fish

## Thank you contributors!
