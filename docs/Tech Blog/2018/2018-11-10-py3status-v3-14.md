I'm happy to announce this release as it contains some very interesting developments in the project. This [release was focused](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/issues/1526) on core changes.  

## IMPORTANT notice

There are now two [optional dependencies](https://py3status.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installation) to py3status:

- **gevent**
    - will monkey patch the code to make it concurrent
    - the main benefit is to use an asynchronous loop instead of threads  
        
- **pyudev**
    - will enable a udev monitor if a module asks for it (only xrandr so far)
    - the benefit is described below  
        

To install them all using pip, simply do:  

pip install py3status[all]

## Modules can now react/refresh on udev events  

When pyudev is available, py3status will [allow modules to subscribe and react to udev events](https://py3status.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#refreshing-modules-on-udev-events-with-on-udev-dynamic-options)!

The xrandr module uses this feature by default which allows the module to instantly refresh when you plug in or off a secondary monitor. This also allows to stop running the xrandr command in the background and saves a lot of CPU!

## Highlights

- py3status core uses black formatter
- fix default i3status.conf detection
    - add ~/.config/i3 as a default config directory, closes #1548
    - add .config/i3/py3status in default user modules include directories
- add markup (pango) support for modules (#1408), by @MikaYuoadas
- py3: notify_user module name in the title (#1556), by @lasers
- print module information to sdtout instead of stderr (#1565), by @robertnf
- battery_level module: default to using sys instead of acpi (#1562), by @eddie-dunn
- imap module: fix output formatting issue (#1559), by @girst
