Another long awaited release has come true **thanks to our community**!

The [changelog](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status/blob/master/CHANGELOG) is so huge that I had to open an issue and cry for help to make it happen... thanks again **@lasers** for stepping up once again :)

## Highlights

- **gevent support** (-g option) to switch from threads scheduling to greenlets and reduce resources consumption
- [**environment variables support**](http://py3status.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#environment-variables) in i3status.conf to remove sensible information from your config
- modules can now leverage a **persistent data store**
- **hundreds of improvements** for various modules
- we now have an official **debian package**
- we reached 500 stars on github #vanity

## Milestone 3.9

- try to release a version faster than every 4 months (j/k) ;)

The next release will focus on bugs and modules improvements / standardization.

## Thanks contributors!

This release is their work, thanks a lot guys!
