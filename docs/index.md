### Gentoo Linux developer

I've been a [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org) developer for more than 10 years now. I mainly focus on [packaging](https://packages.gentoo.org/maintainer/ultrabug@gentoo.org) distributed databases ecosystems and cluster related projects. I'm also part of the team who provides [gentoo linux docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/gentoo).

### Open Source author and contributor

I'm strongly involved in various Open Source communities and am spending a fair amount of my time contributing to Open Source projects.

I am the author of several Open Source projects, for instance:

- [py3status](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status): an [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) i3status wrapper written in Python
- [uhashring](https://github.com/ultrabug/uhashring): a full featured consistent hashing Python library compatible with ketama
- [matterhook](https://github.com/numberly/matterhook): a Python library to interact with Mattermost Webhooks

This is a quick list of projects I have contributed to:

- [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) / [PyMongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver)
- [Python asyncio Kafka library](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiokafka)
- [Scylla](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla) / [Scylla Python Driver](https://github.com/scylladb/python-driver)

### Tech speaker & writer

I've been fortunate since some of my talk proposals have been accepted over the last years at [tech conferences](/Tech Talks/) where I got to participate as a speaker.

This is very important for me because I believe that real world experience is never as useful as when it's shared with your peers and community.

[I also write blog posts](/Tech Blog/) about some of the technical challenges I face and some Open Source news in the hope it is of interest or help to someone.

### Awarded community member

I've been very humbled to be [interviewed and awarded](/Tech Talks/) for my community work and professional experience.

## FPV Hobby

When I'm not hacking computers and code I like to hack quadcopters and to fly them in [FPV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_view_(radio_control))!

I share my modest experience on this hobby through my [FPV Handbook](/FPV Handbook/) and [FPV Builds](/FPV Builds/) guides.
