# Introduction

:gb: Hello fellow FPV pilot!

This handbook serves as a way for me to keep and reference all the links and assets that have been helpful to me in this hobby. I share it publicly in case it could help someone in the community!

This is an Open Source project so feel free to contribute by opening a discussion in a Github issue or proposing a change using a Pull Request.

Happy flying!
