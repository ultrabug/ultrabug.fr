A retrospective and prospective of Python’s adoption in the **data-driven industries** and how it has and should influence its ecosystem and communities.

Thanks to its versatility, Python’s usage and adoption has changed a lot over the last decade to go beyond the very act of software programming.

From Developers to SysOps, closely followed by Scientists and Data analysts, Python has spread to become a common tongue for a wide range of people.

We will start by looking at how this increased adoption impacted Python ecosystem and is still shaping it today. While **this talk is not walk through all the Python technologies around data**, some of them will be outlined so you will hear words like Numpy, Pandas or Jupyter.

Then we will try to project ourselves in the future and by **highlighting the pitfalls Python has to overcome** to keep up with its pace and mature in its ability to **scale**!
