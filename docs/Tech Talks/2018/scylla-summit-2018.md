# Scylla Summit 2018

## Scylla User Award: Contribution to Scylla Open Source

I'm proud to have been chosen for the **Contribution to Scylla Open Source** award during the summit.

I've been contributing to Scylla through my Gentoo Linux packaging as well as to the Python code base, writing quite a bunch of blog posts and helping around in the general Slack channel.
