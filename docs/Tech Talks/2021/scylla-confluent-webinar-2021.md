## Building Event Streaming Architectures on Scylla and Confluent with Kafka

I had the privilege to share the stage with Confluent's [Tim Berglund](https://twitter.com/tlberglund) and my colleague Othmane El Metioui for this great webinar.

This was a particular day as Tim's daughter happened to be in the middle of her labor and was about to give birth to his first grandson while we were live on stage. And at the same time Confluent announced they were going public!

[Peter Corless of ScyllaDB did a great write-up of the webinar](https://www.scylladb.com/2021/06/24/building-event-streaming-architectures-on-scylla-and-confluent-with-kafka/) where we shared on how we combine the powers of Scylla and Confluent Kafka at Numberly.
