## Tech for Good, build the world you want to live in

As a EuroPython 2021 Gold sponsor, Numberly had a 30 minutes talk slot reserved on the conference agenda. Instead of using it to promote ourselves, we decided to hand over the stage to some of the non profit organization we support and work with through our 1000mercis Impacts fundation.
